# ENTS Compression Algorithims 

Compression algorithims are being increasingly explored in [IoT settings](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10330191) to streamline data transmission to save power and bandwidth. 

Here we are exploring how the following compression algorithims impact the performance of the ENTS board when combined with ProtoBuf serilization.

1. LZ77
2. LZ78
3. LZQ
4. LZMA
5. Run length encoding
6. Asymmetric numerical systems
7. Arithmetic Coding
